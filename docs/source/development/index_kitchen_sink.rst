============
Kitchen Sink
============

This is meant to show all elements available from `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and its extensions.

For an extensive showcase see `Furo theme website <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/kitchen-sink/>`_.

Both 
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_ 
and 
`MarkDown <https://www.markdownguide.org/>`_ 
are shown.

.. warning::

   While sphinx natively supports ``reStructuredText``, ``MarkDown`` support has to be enabled via MyST-Parser (see `here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html#markdown>`_). Some inhomogeneities may be present between otputs from ``rST`` and ``MD`` sources.
