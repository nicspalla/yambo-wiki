============
Kitchen Sink
============

This is meant to show all elements available from `sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ and its extensions.

For a more complete showcase see `Furo theme website <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/kitchen-sink/>`__.

The focus here is on 
`reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__ 
syntax, but some things in MarkDown (MD) are also shown.

.. warning::

   While sphinx natively supports ``reStructuredText``, ``MarkDown`` support has to be enabled via MyST-Parser (see `here <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/markdown.html#markdown>`__). Some inhomogeneities may be present between otputs from ``rST`` and ``MD`` sources.

.. important::

   For MD syntax see the `MyST documentation <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/admonitions.html>`__.
